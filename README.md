# Arduino children's organ / synthesizer

All of the hard work was done in [this project](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/michalin70/arduino-as-waveform-synthesizer-for-music-2aa48f). The concept of the 1-T amplifier is explained [here](https://github.com/earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio). And then I did a little work to create a children's organ / synth from it.

It has two voices, and aims to be parent-friendly (= not too loud). A video of the toy in action can be found [here](https://player.vimeo.com/video/697678995).
